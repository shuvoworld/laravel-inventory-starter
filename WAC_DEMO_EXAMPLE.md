# Weighted Average Cost (WAC) Implementation

## üéØ What We've Built

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive **Weighted Average Cost (COGS) system** that automatically calculates the true cost of products based on their purchase history.

## üìã Example Calculation

Let's say you purchase **Dell Latitude 5520 Laptop** at different times:

### Purchase 1: January 2025
- **Quantity**: 10 units @ **$950.00** each
- **Total Value**: $950.00 √ó 10 = **$9,500.00**
- **Running Totals**: 10 units, $9,500.00
- **WAC after Purchase 1**: $9,500.00 √∑ 10 = **$950.00**

### Purchase 2: March 2025
- **Quantity**: 20 units @ **$980.00** each
- **Total Value**: $980.00 √ó 20 = **$19,600.00**
- **Running Totals**: 30 units, $29,100.00
- **WAC after Purchase 2**: $29,100.00 √∑ 30 = **$970.00**

### Purchase 3: June 2025
- **Quantity**: 15 units @ **$1,020.00** each
- **Total Value**: $1,020.00 √ó 15 = **$15,300.00**
- **Running Totals**: 45 units, $44,400.00
- **WAC after Purchase 3**: $44,400.00 √∑ 45 = **$986.67**

## üéØ Final Result

The **Weighted Average Cost** for the Dell laptop is **$986.67 per unit**.

This becomes your **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)** for profit calculations.

## üí∞ Profit Calculation Example

If you sell 1 laptop for $1,299.99:

- **Selling Price**: $1,299.99
- **COGS (WAC)**: $986.67
- **Gross Profit**: $1,299.99 - $986.67 = **$313.32**
- **Profit Margin**: ($313.32 √∑ $1,299.99) √ó 100 = **24.1%**

## üîß System Features

### 1. **Automatic WAC Calculation**
```php
// Get WAC for any product
$wac = WeightedAverageCostService::calculateWeightedAverageCost($productId);
```

### 2. **Real-Time Updates**
When you mark a purchase order as "received" or "confirmed", the system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Updates WAC for all products in the order
- ‚úÖ Clears cache to reflect new costs
- ‚úÖ Recalculates profit margins

### 3. **Purchase History Tracking**
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --product-id=1 --show-history
```

Shows complete purchase history with running WAC calculations.

### 4. **Comprehensive Analysis**
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --show-analysis
```

Provides insights like:
- Total products with purchase history
- WAC distribution (low/medium/high cost products)
- Products needing cost price adjustments
- Total inventory value at true cost

## üè™ Business Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Profit Tracking**
- No more guessing product costs
- Real COGS based on actual purchase prices
- Accurate profit margins

### 2. **Inventory Valuation**
- Know true value of your inventory
- Better financial reporting
- Accurate balance sheet values

### 3. **Pricing Decisions**
- Set prices based on real costs
- Identify products with thin margins
- Make informed discount decisions

### 4. **Cost Management**
- Track cost increases over time
- Identify supplier price changes
- Optimize purchasing timing

## üìä How It Works in Practice

### When Creating Sales Orders:
- System automatically uses WAC for COGS calculation
- Profit calculations are accurate
- Reports show real margins

### When Receiving Purchase Orders:
- WAC automatically updates for affected products
- Future sales use new, accurate costs
- Historical sales remain unchanged

### In Financial Reports:
- P&L statements show accurate COGS
- Inventory values are correct
- Profit margins are realistic

## üéØ Implementation Status

‚úÖ **WeightedAverageCostService** - Core WAC calculations
‚úÖ **Product Model Integration** - WAC methods available
‚úÖ **COGS Service Updates** - Uses WAC for all calculations
‚úÖ **Purchase Order Integration** - Auto-updates WAC
‚úÖ **Analysis Commands** - Comprehensive reporting tools
‚úÖ **Caching System** - Performance optimized
‚úÖ **Fallback Logic** - Uses cost_price when no purchase history

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Check WAC for a product:
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --product-id=1
```

### See purchase history:
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --product-id=1 --show-history
```

### Get full analysis:
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --show-analysis
```

### Find products with cost discrepancies:
```bash
php artisan inventory:analyze-wac --show-differences
```
