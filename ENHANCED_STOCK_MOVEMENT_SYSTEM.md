## 🔧 Core Features

### **1. Automatic Movement Type Detection**
```php
// System automatically determines IN/OUT/ADJUSTMENT based on transaction type
$movementType = StockMovement::getMovementDirection('damage'); // Returns 'out'
$movementType = StockMovement::getMovementDirection('recovery_found'); // Returns 'in'
```

### **2. Source of Truth Stock Calculation**
```php
// Calculate current stock purely from movements (definitive source)
$currentStock = StockMovement::getCurrentStockFromMovements($productId);

// Calculate stock at any point in time
$stockAtDate = StockMovement::getStockAtDate($productId, Carbon::parse('2025-01-15'));
```

### **3. Smart Stock Validation**
```php
// Skip validation for unavoidable losses
$skipStockValidation = ['damage', 'lost_missing', 'theft', 'expired', 'quality_control'];

// Enforce validation for controllable movements
if ($movementType === 'out' && !in_array($transactionType, $skipStockValidation)) {
    // Check stock availability
}
```

### **4. Complete Service Methods**
```php
// IN movements
StockMovementService::recordTransferIn($productId, $quantity, $referenceId, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordRecovery($productId, $quantity, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordManufacturingIn($productId, $quantity, $referenceId, $notes);

// OUT movements
StockMovementService::recordDamage($productId, $quantity, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordLost($productId, $quantity, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordExpired($productId, $quantity, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordQualityControl($productId, $quantity, $notes);
StockMovementService::recordPromotional($productId, $quantity, $notes);
```

## 📈 Stock Reconciliation System

### **1. Discrepancy Detection**
- Compares system stock vs. calculated stock from movements
- Identifies products with data inconsistencies
- Provides detailed movement history for investigation

### **2. Automated Reconciliation**
```php
// Process reconciliation with automatic adjustment
$difference = $actualCount - $currentStock;
if ($difference > 0) {
    StockMovementService::recordStockCountCorrectionPlus($product->id, abs($difference), $notes);
} else {
    StockMovementService::recordStockCountCorrectionMinus($product->id, abs($difference), $notes);
}
```

### **3. Physical Count Sheets**
- Printable count sheets for warehouse staff
- Current stock levels from movements
- Last movement timestamps
- Product organization by category/location

### **4. Real-time Stock API**
```json
GET /api/stock-from-movements?product_id=123
{
    "product_id": 123,
    "product_name": "Dell Laptop",
    "system_stock": 22,
    "movement_stock": 22,
    "discrepancy": 0,
    "last_updated": "2025-01-15 14:30:00"
}
```

## 🎨 Enhanced Visual Display

### **Grid Improvements**
- **Direction-based color coding**: Green for IN, Red for OUT, Yellow for Adjustments
- **Emoji indicators**: Visual transaction type recognition
- **Critical highlighting**: Bold red for damage/loss/theft scenarios
- **Direction icons**: Plus/minus/balance scale icons

### **Transaction Type Examples**
```
🟢 (+5) 📦 Purchase Order #PO-001
🔴 (-2) ⚠️ Damage - Items dropped during handling
🔴 (-1) 🔒 Theft - Security incident #SEC-45
🟢 (+3) 🔍 Found/Recovered - Previously missing item located
```

```

### **2. Recording Recovery of Lost Items**
```php
StockMovementService::recordRecovery(
    $productId,
    2,
    'Items found in storage room during cleanup'
);
```

### **3. Stock Reconciliation**
```php
// Get discrepancies
$discrepancies = StockMovementController::reconcile();

// Process actual count
StockMovementController::processReconciliation([
    'product_id' => 123,
    'actual_count' => 45,
    'notes' => 'Physical count completed 2025-01-15'
]);
```

### **4. Quality Control Rejection**
```php
StockMovementService::recordQualityControl(
    $productId,
    10,
    'Failed quality inspection - packaging damaged'
);
```
