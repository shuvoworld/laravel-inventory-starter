# Stock Movement Flow - Correct Implementation

## 📊 Stock Movement Logic

### ✅ **IN Movements** (Increase Inventory)
- **Purchase Orders** (`recordPurchase`) - Stock IN from suppliers
- **Sales Returns** (`recordSaleReturn`) - Stock IN from customer returns
- **Opening Stock** (`recordOpeningStock`) - Initial inventory setup
- **Stock Transfers IN** - Stock received from other locations

### ❌ **OUT Movements** (Decrease Inventory)
- **Sales Orders** (`recordSale`) - Stock OUT to customers
- **Purchase Returns** (`recordPurchaseReturn`) - Stock OUT to suppliers
- **Damage/Loss** (`recordDamage`) - Stock OUT due to damage
- **Theft** (`recordTheft`) - Stock OUT due to theft
- **Stock Transfers OUT** - Stock sent to other locations

### ⚖️ **Adjustments** (Manual Quantity Changes)
- **Manual Adjustments** (`recordAdjustment`) - Manual stock corrections
- **Stock Counts** - Physical inventory corrections
- **System Corrections** - Data integrity fixes

## 🔄 Transaction Flow Examples

### Purchase Order Flow
```
1. Create Purchase Order → recordPurchase() → IN Movement → +Quantity
2. Receive Items → Stock Added → Inventory Increases
3. Return Items to Supplier → recordPurchaseReturn() → OUT Movement → -Quantity
```

### Sales Order Flow
```
1. Create Sales Order → recordSale() → OUT Movement → -Quantity
2. Ship to Customer → Stock Removed → Inventory Decreases
3. Customer Returns Item → recordSaleReturn() → IN Movement → +Quantity
```

### Manual Adjustment Flow
```
1. Physical Stock Count → recordAdjustment() → Adjustment Movement
2. System Updates → Stock Corrected → Inventory Corrected
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Database Calculations
```sql
-- IN Movement: Increases stock
UPDATE products SET quantity_on_hand = quantity_on_hand + ? WHERE id = ?

-- OUT Movement: Decreases stock
UPDATE products SET quantity_on_hand = quantity_on_hand - ? WHERE id = ?

-- Adjustment: Sets exact quantity
UPDATE products SET quantity_on_hand = ? WHERE id = ?
```

### Stock Validation
- ✅ **OUT movements require stock availability check**
- ✅ **IN movements always allowed**
- ✅ **Adjustments can set any quantity**
- ✅ **Real-time stock updates via model events**

### Error Prevention
- 🚫 **Prevents negative stock for OUT movements**
- 🚫 **Validates product existence**
- 🚫 **Requires user authentication**
- 🚫 **Logs all changes for audit trail**

## 🧪 Test Results

### Sample Test Run
```
Starting Stock: 22 units
After Purchase (+10): 32 units ✅
After Sale (-3): 29 units ✅
After Purchase Return (-2): 27 units ✅
After Sale Return (+1): 28 units ✅
Final Stock: 28 units (22 + 10 - 3 - 2 + 1 = 28) ✅
```

## 📋 Audit Trail

### Every Movement Records:
- **Product ID** - Which product moved
- **Movement Type** - IN/OUT/Adjustment
- **Transaction Type** - Purchase/Sale/Return/etc
- **Quantity** - How many units moved
- **User ID** - Who made the movement
- **Reference** - Related order/document
- **Timestamp** - When movement occurred
- **Notes** - Reason/description

### Complete Traceability
- 🔍 **Search by product** → Full movement history
- 🔍 **Search by date range** → Movement trends
- 🔍 **Search by user** → User activity
- 🔍 **Search by transaction type** → Specific flow analysis
